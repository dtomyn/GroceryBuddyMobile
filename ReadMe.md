Grocery Buddy application created for UltraHackathon

TODOs remaining in overall functionality:

**************************************************************************************************************
Must haves...
**************************************************************************************************************

	**********************
	For Jayper (?)...
	- barcode scanning off of adding a cart item... use this as a HOWTO https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner
		NOTE: I have started to piece this together as can be seen in the "Index.html" at the top and the "ScanIt.js" file
	- get setup so can submit to Apple and Android stores

	For the below, probably get Jayper to do in order to have someone else work on the overall code to get a feel for it...
	- validations... use knockout.validation.js probably over jquery.validate.js?
	- edit an existing cart item
	- editing cart name... leverage existing screen for adding shopping cart?
	- better confirm deletes instead of using ugly "confirm"
	**********************

	**********************
	For Tom (?)...
	- how will $ amounts show? i.e. mockups
	- how will best stores show? i.e. mockups
	- writeup of application for Hackathon / determining how going to present
	**********************

	**********************
	For Darek (?)...
	- persisting data locally
	- calling a REST service probably from Azure to lookup SKU information and prices / stores. Probably use webapi?
	- implement functionality listed under Tom's name above once they are mocked up
	**********************

**************************************************************************************************************
Nice to haves...
**************************************************************************************************************

**********************
- call off to an external service to get SKU information
- map showing distance to nearest store that has an item... showing driving instructions too?
- offline support
- synching up data to remote location... but then would need to authenticate!!
- cleanup images and flow
